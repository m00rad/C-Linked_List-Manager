# C-Linked_List-manager
At the conclusion of the C Programming course within the ITI Embedded System Diploma program, students were tasked with an assignment. They were required to create a console application capable of performing various operations on linked lists in C. Instead of just meeting the basic requirements, I decided to push the boundaries and develop a comprehensive system that utilizes pointers, dynamic memory allocation, structures, and the Bubble Sort algorithm.

The application provides users with a menu of options, enabling them to manipulate the linked list in various ways. These options include:

1. **To Add Node:** Allows the user to add a node to the end of the list (Mandatory).
2. **To Add Node At:** Provides the option to add a node at a specific position in the list (Extra).
3. **To Remove Node:** Enables the user to remove a node by its index (Extra).
4. **To Update Node:** Allows for updating the data value of a node (Extra).
5. **To Show the List:** Displays the entire linked list (Mandatory).
6. **To Get List Size:** Provides the list's current size (Extra).
7. **To Delete the List:** Allows the user to delete the entire linked list (Extra).
8. **To Clear the Screen:** Provides an option to clear the console window (Extra).
9. **To Search for Node:** Lets the user search for a specific node value in the list (Extra).
10. **To Get Element At:** Retrieves a node's data at a specific position in the list (Extra).
11. **To Arrange List:** Sorts the list in ascending order based on node values (Extra).
12. **To Exit:** Allows the user to exit the application(Mandatory), ensuring proper memory deallocation (Extra).

This comprehensive system offers users a wide range of functionalities to work with linked lists, making it a powerful and user-friendly tool for managing and manipulating data within the list.
